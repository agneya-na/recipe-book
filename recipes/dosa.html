    <p>Dosas are a thin, savory crepe-like Indian pancake traditionally eaten for breakfast, but I like them anytime. These may not be very authentic, but they are a tasty alternative that appeals to the typical American pancake.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup brown rice flour, ½ cup whole wheat flour, 1 ½ cups water,1 red onion, finely chopped,1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh cilantro, chopped, ¼ teaspoon white sugar, ½ teaspoon ground turmeric,1 teaspoon ground cumin,2 teaspoons whole mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 teaspoon ground coriander, 1 teaspoon ground ginger, 1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar,1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>       
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make home-made Dosa</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir the brown rice and whole wheat flours together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the water to make a thin batter. Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, sugar, turmeric, cumin, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, coriander, ginger, cayenne pepper and rice vinegar until evenly blended. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour, or overnight.</li>
        <li>To cook the dosas, heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet, spreading it over the bottom in a thin layer. Cook 1 minute, turn, and cook 1 minute more. Remove from the pan. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
